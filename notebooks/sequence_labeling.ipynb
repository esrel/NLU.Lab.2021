    "\n",
    "[Sequence Labeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_labeling) is a type of pattern recognition task that involves the algorithmic assignment of a categorical label to each member of a sequence of observed values. It is a sub-class of [structured (output) learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_prediction), since we are predicting a *sequence* object rather than a discrete or real value predicted in classification problems.\n",
